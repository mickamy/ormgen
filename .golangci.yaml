    - cyclop           # Redundant; cognitive complexity is already tracked by gocognit
    - depguard         # Import restrictions are not currently required for this internal architecture
    - dogsled          # Multiple blank identifiers are unavoidable with some stdlib functions (e.g. runtime.Caller)
    - err113           # Sentinel errors are used where meaningful; contextual fmt.Errorf is preferred elsewhere
    - dupl             # High false-positive rate in test suites where setup code is similar
    - exhaustruct      # Hinders use of default values; too boilerplate-heavy for large structs
    - forbidigo        # Essential for CLI tools that rely on fmt.Print for user output
    - funlen           # Testing logic and table-driven tests naturally exceed standard length
    - gochecknoglobals # Necessary for certain package-level configurations or singleton patterns
    - gochecknoinits   # Required for specific library registrations and setup hooks
    - gocognit         # Thresholds are often too low for complex but necessary business logic
    - gomoddirectives  # Local replace directives are needed for the example module
    - goconst          # Repeated strings in tests are clearer than abstract constants
    - godot            # Punctuation in comments is a stylistic choice, not a code quality issue
    - ireturn          # Returning interfaces is a valid design pattern in this project's architecture
    - mnd              # "Magic numbers" are often self-explanatory (e.g., status codes, time units)
    - nestif           # Deep nesting is sometimes the most readable way to handle complex logic
    - nlreturn         # Forcing newlines before returns is purely stylistic and often disruptive
    - nonamedreturns   # Named returns improve documentation and clarity for complex signatures
    - revive           # Most rules are already covered by more specialized linters
    - varnamelen       # Short, idiomatic names (i, k, v) are preferred in concise Go code
    - wsl              # Excessive whitespace enforcement often degrades code density and readability
